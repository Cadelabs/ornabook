# Dungeons
## What are Dungeons?

There are several different types of dungeons in the Orna world.
  - "Regular" dungeons which will have a random name such as "IMQOMQHAL DUNGEON".  (T3)
    - These will have a random selection of enemies of all types.
    - They are considered "Normal" difficulty.
  - Goblin Fortress  (T3)
    - These will be filled with goblin and orc family type monsters.
    - They are considered "Normal" difficulty.
    - You will get extra gold when you finish this type of dungeon.
  - Dragon Roost (T5)
    - These will be filled with dragon type monsters and bosses
    - They are considered "Normal" difficulty.
    - You will get extra orns when you finish this type of dungeons.
    - Dragon roosts are a decent spot for attempting to God Forge items, as the "Glatisant" boss shows up fairly frequently.
  - Beast Den  (T3)
    - These will be filled with animals and birds.
    - They are considered "Normal" difficulty.
    - You will get extra orns when you finish this type of dungeons.
    - Except during events, most people don't bother to much about these as they don't contain very many good drops except during events such as Kerberos.
  - Valley of the Gods (T10)
    - These are filled with bosses, and various arisen enemies.
    - They are considered "Brutal" difficulty.
    - They are a good option for trying to God Forge items, as there are many Gods in these dungeons.
  - Mystic Cave (T3)
    - These are considered "Normal" difficulty and are filled with a variety of "magical" enemies.
    - Completeing these dungeons will award extra orns.
    - During some events, the Mystic Cave is a useful dugeon for the event mobs. (Beguiled Appollyon for example)
  - Battle Grounds (T8)
    - These are filled with human warrior type enemies.
    - They are considered "Brutal" difficulty.
    - They are a decent option for God Forging as Baldr is a frequent flyer here (also his boots are very nice).
  - Chaos Portal (T6)
    - Chaos portals are "Hard" difficulty
    - They are filled with a variety of enemies, especially those that are weather dependent.
    - They are a decent option for farming chaos scrolls as balor gateways are a weather (moon beam) dependant spawn.
  - Underworld Portal (T9)
    - These dungeons are filled with the "Balor" family of enemies.
    - They are "Hard" difficulty
    - They are, as a T9 or above, the best option for farming summoning scrolls.


## Dungeon Options
### Normal mode
This is the default setting for a dungeon.  You will encounter 1 monster per floor (except for special occasions/boss floors which may have 1 or 2 additional mobs) and will be allowed to use potions and other consumables.

### Horde mode
Horde mode was introduced in 2022 to help combat the reliance on party play and alts.  This allows a single player to encounter multiple enemies per floor, much like you would when doing dungeons in a group with your party.  Selecting "Horde mode" will increase the stated difficult mode to a minimum of "Hard".    Horde mode is available in all dungeons, except for your personal guantlet.    Choosing horde mode will not increase the dungeon cooldown timers.

### Hard mode
Hard mode is available in all dungeon types and by selecting it you will not be able to use any consumeables(potions and whatnot) in the dungeon.  Hard mode will give you additional rewards on each floor as well as additonal end of dungeons rewards.  Hardmode will increase the cooldown timer on the dungeon.

### Boss mode
Boss mode is only available in regular dungeons including the one in your keep and your personal guantlet.  Boss mode will populate every floor, instead of only on the designated 'boss' floors.   Boss mode will increase the cooldown timer on the dungeon.

### Include event content
The default state for this is option is on.  This option is only available themed dungeons (not "normal" ones) and if unchecked it will keep the event mobs from polluting the regular spawn selection of the dungeon.

### Endless
This mode is fairly self-explanatory.  Instead of having the regular number of floors, there is no end to these, until you die.   Each floor becomes increasingly more difficult and with that increased difficulty, the rewards of XP and orns also increase.   Endless can be combined with Hard Mode, but it cannot be combined with Boss mode or Horde mode. It is only available in normal dungeons, including your personal dungeon, and the one found in an upgraded keep/castle.   Endless dungeons have a large increase in the cooldown.

## Dungeon Floors
As your tier increases the number of floors in dungeons increases:
  - T3 - 10 floors
  - T5 - 13 floors
  - T8 - 20 floors
  - T10 - 22 floors
  - T11 - 25 floors
