# Dungeons :dungeon:
## What are dungeons?
Dungeons are an activity in which a player explores a monster filled dungeon. One needs to be Tier 3 in order to access a dungeon. The depth of dungeons varies with the Tier of the player opening the dungeon. With each floor in the dungeon comes a battle. Players can only proceed to deeper floors under the condition that they win their battle. At the end of a dungeon, players obtain additional rewards such as materials or other items (oftentimes referred to as EoG/EoD rewards, for end-of-Gauntlet/Dungeon rewards).

Once the dungeon has started, players have no opportunity to rest. While they cannot heal, dungeons can still be fled from to change gear/class/pet and re-entered with a new loadout. In this case, Ward/HP/MP may be clamped if the _max_ Ward/HP/MP of the new loadout is lower than the _current_ Ward/HP/MP when the dungeon was last fled from.

Although one cannot heal between battles, status effects (whether negative or positive) do remain from one floor to the next one. A common strategy which makes heavy use of that is to use the first floor(s) to apply as many buffs as possible, which can be kept until the end of the dungeon, in order to one shot as many floors as possible.

Monsters defeated in a dungeon only reward half of their base Gold, Orn and Exp rewards (TODO(ethiraric, 02/06/2023): items?).

## Finding dungeons
The main source of dungeons is the world map, where they can be found as buildings. They do not move, nor do they disappear. They may appear randomly, as can any other building. They cannot be built by players.

Other means of running dungeons are:
  - Through a :wayvessel:Wayvessel, running dungeons accessible from the remote Wayvessel.
  - In the Fortress / Castle, which have one dungeon that can be opened only by the Fortress / Castle owner (note: the Keep does not have a dungeon).
  - In the main menu, using the Menu Gauntlet (note: this dungeon is personal and cannot be run with the party).

It is common for people to "share" their dungeon spots. They create another account whose purpose is to build a Wayvessel in reach of a maximum of dungeons and to invite others to come to their Wayvessel to run dungeons. Some Discord servers have that kind of service available, and Kingdoms usually have their own member-restricted system.

## Themed dungeons
There exists multiple dungeon themes, which change what families of monsters can be encountered in the dungeon. Dungeon themes rotate for existing dungeons every week at Monday 00:00UTC. At that time, each dungeon's theme is rolled for the next week (it may happen that a dungeon keeps the same theme for 2 weeks in a row). Not all themes weigh equally in the roll and some dungeons are rarer than others.

Each theme requires the player to be at least a certain Tier in order to view them. If the player does not meet that Tier requirement, they will see the dungeon as a regular one. For example, :valley_of_gods:Valleys of the Gods require the player to have reach T10. Where a Valley stands, a T9 or less player will see a :dungeon:regular dungeon.

The full list of themes can be found [on the playorna website](https://playorna.com/codex/dungeons/).

### Regular dungeons :dungeon:
Regular dungeons are the most common ones. They may contain any monster in the game as long as it doesn't belong to an inactive event (e.g.: Follower of Kerberos) or is locked to a specific dungeon theme (e.g.: Glatisant, only found in :dragon_roost:Dragon Roosts). They do not have any specific reward boost upon completion.

Regular dungeons offer the best balance for farming content.

### Goblin Fortresses :fort:
Goblin Fortresses are available starting Tier 3. They contain only monsters in the Orc Horde and Goblin Horde families. They reward additional Gold upon completion.

They have boss floors which, even if the dungeon was run non-horde mode, will contain multiple enemies.

TODO(ethiraric, 02/06/2023): Advantages of farming them?

Goblin Fortresses are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Alfars during the _A Year's End_ event

### Mystic Caves :mystic_cave:
Mystic Caves are available starting Tier 3. They contain only monsters in the Magical and Ancient families. They reward additional Orns upon completion.

Farming them is a great way to stock up on Elemental stones and Platinum. Running them Hard-Horde is also a great way of piling Orns up, but can be risky with (Arisen) Immortal Lords.

Mystic Caves are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Lost Memories, not restricted to a particular event
  - Pupils and Apprentices during the _The Plight of Apollyon_ event

### Beast Dens :beast_den:
Beast Dens are available starting Tier 3. They contain only monsters in the Animal family. They reward additional Orns upon completion.

They have boss floors which, even if the dungeon was run non-horde mode, will contain multiple enemies.

Farming them is a great way to stock up on Hardened Steel. Running them Hard-Horde is also a great way of piling Orns up.
Most of the time, people do not bother too much about them because the drops from the monsters are not noteworthy.

Beast Dens are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Kerberos and its followers during the _Rise/Return of Kerberos_ events

### Dragon Roosts :dragon_roost:
Dragon Roosts are available starting Tier 5. They contain only monsters in the Draconian Forces and Dragon families. They reward additional Orns upon completion.

They are mostly farmed for Glatisant, which can show up Tier 9 onwards, for its Questing weapons and a chance at Godforging. Note that Glatisant will not appear in Tiers 5 to 8.

Dragon Roosts are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Glatisant, not restricted to a particular event
  - The Phoenicians and the (Arisen) Phoenix monsters during the _Rise/Return of the Phoenix_ events

### Chaos Portals :chaos_portal:
Chaos Portals are available starting Tier 6. They contain only weather- or time-restricted monsters. They reward additional end-of-Dungeon items upon completion.

They are primarily farmed for :summoning_scroll:Summoning Scrolls, as :gateway:Balor Gateways are Moonlight-restricted monsters. Other than that, the :gauntlet_keys:key cost and difficulty make it an often skipped dungeon.

Chaos Portals are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Stable Keepers, not restricted to a particular event

### Battlegrounds :battlegrounds:
Battlegrounds are available starting Tier 8. They contain only monsters in the Lyonesse Forces and Nothren Forces families. They reward additional end-of-Dungeon items upon completion.

They are primarily farmed for Baldr gear and Godforges (Arisen King Meliodas and Baldr). While very hard, Hard-Horde Battlegrounds reward with huge amounts of Orns.

Battlegrounds are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Arisen King Meliodas and Baldr, not restricted to a particular event

### Underworld Portals :underworld_portal:
Underworld Portals are available starting Tier 9. They contain only monsters in the Balor Forces family. They reward additional end-of-Dungeon items upon completion.

They are the most popular dungeon for their :gateway:Balor Gateways and farming :summoning_scroll:Summoning Scrolls.

Underworld Portals are home to these theme-restricted monsters:
  - Knight Sirius, not restricted to a particular event

### Valleys of the Gods :valley_of_gods:
Valleys of the Gods are available starting Tier 10. They contain only arisen monsters. They reward additional Gold, Orns and end-of-Dungeon items upon completion.

They have boss floors which, even if the dungeon was run non-horde mode, will contain multiple enemies.

Although expensive (:gauntlet_keys:20), they are the best option for Godforging items.

They also include key cost (1 default, 2 for Dragon Roosts, 5 for Chaos, Underworld and Battlegrounds and 20 for the Valleys) and what the game considers their difficulty (Normal default, Hard for Chaos and Underworld, Brutal for Battlegrounds and Valleys)." src="/img/dungeon_summary.png" width="80%" />

## Dungeon options and key cost multipliers
Alongside themes, other difficulty modifiers can be applied to the dungeons for increased rewards, some of which may increase the key cost or dungeon cooldown.

These modifiers are split into 2 categories:
  - Modes (Normal, Horde, Endless), one of which exactly must be selected at a time
  - Options (Hard, Boss, Include event content) which may both be activated

Any combination except for Endless/Boss is valid. Themed dungeon cannot be run as Endless nor Boss.

### Normal mode
This is the default setting for a dungeon. On each floor you will face 1 monster onl , except for boss floors for some themed dungeons which may have 1 or 2 additional monsters.

### Horde mode
Horde mode was introduced in 2022 to help combat the reliance on party play and alts. This allows a single player to encounter multiple enemies per floor, much like you would when doing party dungeons in a group. Horde mode is available in all dungeons, except for your personal gauntlet. Choosing horde mode will not increase the dungeon cooldown timers.

Horde mode does not incur a key cost multiplier, except on regular dungeons where the key cost is multiplied by 3.

### Endless mode
In Endless mode, instead of having a set number of floors, dungeons may go infinitely deep and end when the player is defeated. With each floor enemies' stats increase, but so do their Gold, Orns and Exp rewards. The rewards multiplier for a floor in endless is `floor_number/30`. Since they do not have an "end", endless dungeons do not reward any end-of-Dungeon rewards.

Endless mode is only available on all regular dungeons, including the personal menu gauntlet. It does incur a 5x key cost multiplier and increases the cooldown timer on the dungeon.

### Hard Option
The Hard option is available in all dungeon types. It prevents players from using consumables (potions and whatnot) in the dungeon. Hard mode doubles the amount of Gold, Orn and Exp gained from defeating monsters and guarantees the end-of-Dungeon rewards are at least of Superior quality.

The Hard option incurs a x5 key cost multiplier and increases the cooldown timer on the dungeon.

### Boss Option
The Boss option is only available in regular dungeons, including the one in your Castle/Fortress and your personal guantlet. With it, every monster spawned in the dungeon will be a boss. The Boss option further halves Gold, Orn and Exp rewards. 

The Boss option incurs a x5 key cost multiplier and increases the cooldown timer on the dungeon.

### Include event content Option
The default state for this is option is on. This option is only available for themed dungeons (not regular ones). It allows controlling whether event monsters that would normally appear in the dungeon do appear. For some events, players may prefer to not have event monsters dilute the spawn selection of the dungeon and would uncheck this option.

Activating or not this option does not incur any key cost multiplier.

### Key costs multipliers
When selecting multiple options, their key cost multipliers are not added, but multiplied together (e.g.: Hard is x5, Boss is x5, so Hard-Boss is 25x).

An additional multiplier is applied when starting party dungeons. The key cost of opening the dungeon is multiplied by however many members are _in the party_ up to a maximum of 4x (since no more than 4 players can join a dungeon).

The maximum key cost for a dungeon would be :gauntlet_keys:400 for a Valley of the Gods (20 base :gauntlet_keys: cost) with the Hard Option (x5 = :gauntlet_keys:100) and in a party of 4 (4x = :gauntlet_keys:400).

## Tier of a dungeon and relation to depth
As your tier increases the number of floors in dungeons increases. The following chart shows, for each tier, what the tier of monsters in each floor is, as well as how many floors a dungeon has.

<center>
<img alt="Number of floors per tier. Tier 1: 5 floors. Tier 2: 9 floors. Tier 3 and 4: 10 floors. Tier 5 through 7: 13 floors. Tiers 8 and 9: 20 floors. Tier 10: 22 floors. Tier 11: 25 floors." src="/img/dungeon_floors.png" />
</center>

Number of regular monster floors of each tier with relation to the dungeon tier. Each column corresponds to a dungeon tier. Each row corresponds to a floor tier.

|Floor Tier| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
|:--------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|
|     1    | 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 |   |   |   |   |   |    |    |
|     2    |   | 4 | 5 | 3 | 1 |   |   |   |   |    |    |
|     3    |   |   | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |   |   |   |    |    |
|     4    |   |   |   | 3 | 3 | 1 |   |   |   |    |    |
|     5    |   |   |   |   | 5 | 3 | 2 |   |   |    |    |
|     6    |   |   |   |   |   | 6 | 2 |   |   |    |    |
|     7    |   |   |   |   |   |   | 6 | 7 |   |    |    |
|     8    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |10 | 7 | 4  | 4  |
|     9    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |10 | 9  | 9  |
|    10    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 5  | 8  |

## End of Dungeon rewards
Successfully defeating the last floor of a dungeon rewards with a currently unknown amount of Exp, Gold and Orns. An additional selection of randomly selected materials is awarded to the player.

Finally, an item within the end-of-Dungeon reward pool is also given to the player. This pool includes all quest (including event ones) rewards. The process is as follows:
  - The game randomly selects an item from the pool.
  - If the player has completed the quest, the item is awarded.
  - If, however, the player has **not** completed the quest, the item is not awarded and the player receives no quest item from completing the dungeon.

The last point is important: it means that the odds of receiving a specific item does not depend on how many quests were completed. Holding off from completing quests does not improve the odds of a particular item from a completed quest to appear. It's quite the opposite: it sometimes prevents you from receiving a reward at the end of your dungeon!

Any dungeon can reward with any item, no matter the tier. There are reports of players receiving a T9 Band of Gods from low-tier gauntlets. Quality of the item depends only on whether the dungeon was run with the Hard option or not. No other factor plays in how the game selects the quality. If the dungeon was run as Hard, then the item is at least of Superior quality. Otherwise, it may be of any quality (including Poor and Broken).
