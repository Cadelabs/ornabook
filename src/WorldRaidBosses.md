# World Raid Bosses
## What are World Raid Bosses?
WRBs are Raid Bosses (akin to the Kingdom Raids) that can very rarely appear naturally in the overworld or be summoned by players (T7 or higher) through Summoning Scrolls.

## Where can I get Scrolls?
Summoning Scrolls are found starting from T7. They can be found as drops from Balor Gateways or as end-of-dungeon rewards.

## What happens when I use a Scroll?
When used, the Summoning Scroll summons a random WRB near the player. Summons can either be public (seen by anyone) or private (seen by the player and their party only). Players you have blocked cannot see your WRBs. Any WRB that you see can be attacked. Although happening in the overworld, it uses your Raid Loadout, just like Kingdom Raids.

## How long do I have to kill the WRB?
A WRB stays until killed. They cannot naturally despawn.

## What monsters can I summon?
When used Summoning Scrolls selects from a pool of WRBs that is determined by your tier. A player can only summon WRBs that is in the same tier as themselves or two tiers below. Some WRBS are always in the pool while others are only added during certain events. Permanent WRBs include:
  - T6: Fey Gazer
  - T7: Fey Dragon, First Horseman, Yggdrasil
  - T8: Fey Cockatrice, Second Horseman
  - T9: Fey Yeti, Third Horseman
  - T10: Fey Chimera, Final Horseman, Arisen Morrigan, Arisen Yggdrasil, Ashen Phoenix

## What are event WRBs?
Every month, some time-limited WRBs are added to the pool. For instance, in January, Phoenix and Arisen Phoenix are added to the pool.

## Rewards
WRBs have overall excellent drops. What tier(s) those drops are relevant depends on the WRBs.

The equipment drops from the WRBs usually rank high in useability, some notably being better compared to items a tier above (the highly sought Fey Yeti Coat, namely). (Side note for Kingdom Raids: even though you can hit raids above your tier, you will _not_ drop items above your tier. Likewise certain WRBs can drop items that are a higher tier than themselves which will only drop if you are in the same tier or above)
WRBs give high amounts of XP up until T9. The XP requirements at T10 are such that WRBs no longer are the best XP source. The XP/Orn ratio for WRBs is very high! This means that, if feel you like you need more Orns than XP, WRBs are not the right focus for you now.
With the 3.0 update, WRBs now also drop a decent amount of random materials, including rarer end-game materials (e.g.: Cursed Ortanite), mid-game boss materials (e.g.: Broken Stone) or herbs.

## Where can I find Summoning Scrolls
Summoning Scrolls are obtained from defeating Balor Gateways (T7 or T9) or clearing dungeons. Some WRBs can sometimes drop them (Fey Yeti).
There is no known correlation between hard/normal/themed dungeons and their drop rate for end rewards.
The most efficient way of obtaining them will be to increase our encounters of Balor Gateways or dungeon clears.

Notes:
  - Balor Gateways can very rarely be found on the overworld, but only in Moonlight weather. We will ignore that in the following, as this is by no way a reliable way of farming Summoning Scrolls.
  - Summoning Scrolls are not a _guaranteed_ drop from Balor Gateways.
  - Party Dungeons are preferred to solo dungeons. With a full party of 4, each member can enter the dungeon as a host for the others, meaning a single dungeon location can lead up to 4 runs. When party-running normal dungeons, you will get more mobs as well as you can not run horde mode for normal non themed dungeons.

At Tier 7, the WRBs you can summon do not drop anything notable. This is why it is mostly advised to not use most of your Summoning scrolls.
Plus, Summoning Scrolls are pretty rare. They mostly appear in non-boss dungeons with a pretty low chance.
An efficient way of farming them would be Group Horde Normal dungeons. There are multiple enemies per floor, meaning more chances of Balor Gateways spawning.
Plus, clearing dungeons can reward with a Summoning Scroll.

However, the most efficient way to farm Summoning Scrolls is to run Chaos Portals.
In Chaos Portals, you encounter enemies that usually appear only in particular biomes or weather (remember that Balor Gateways only appear in Moonlight?).
However, they are one of the most difficult dungeons to clear, and their base cost is 5 (20 for a party of 4).
If your only aim is getting Summoning Scrolls, this is the most efficient way. However, be prepared for it to drain your key stash.

Notes:
  - It is not really recommended to use your Summoning Scrolls at T7. They are rare, and the drops from T6-7 WRBs are not relevant. However, using one or two to see how it works is very much recommended.
  - Since the XP/Orn ratio is so high, it is not recommended to farm XP this way, or you may need to farm Orns for a time in order to afford your tierâ€™s classes/pets due to overleveling.


Overall, for farming Summoning Scrolls (from most efficient to less efficient):
  - Party Chaos Portals
  - Solo Horde Chaos Portals
  - Solo Chaos Portals
  - Party regular T7 dungeons
  - Solo regular T7 dungeons

At Tier 8, summoning scrolls are not much easier to come by than T7. However, there is one WRB that is of a bit of interest, Fey Cockatrice. These drop red pinions (armor adornments with att and -def) that are used by people who specialize as Swashbucklers.
During October, you'll also have a chance to summon Pumpkinhead, an event WRB dropping the Bag of Treats, an accessory that slightly increases your XP, Orns, Gold _and_ Luck.

When running a regular dungeon, you have the option to run either a T8 or a T7 dungeon.
Since Balor Gateways is a T7 monster, you want to maximize the amount of T7 floors.
T7 dungeons have 5 T7 floors, while T8 dungeons have 7 T7 floors. Hence scrollwise it would be more efficient to run T8 dungeons rather than T7 dungeons.

Chaos Portals still allow you to get more Balor Gateways encounters than regular dungeons.
Note that T7 Chaos Portals have 13 floors while T8 have 20!

Overall, for farming Summoning Scrolls (from most efficient to less efficient):
  - Party Chaos Portals
  - Solo Horde Chaos Portals
  - Solo Chaos Portals
  - Party regular T8 dungeons
  - Party regular T7 dungeons
  - Solo regular T8 dungeons
  - Solo regular T7 dungeons

Tier 9 starts to get a bit more interesting. The well known Fey Yeti joins the summon pool. You'll have a chance to look for the fabled Fey Yeti Coat, a rare find. There's also the Third Horseman that is added to the summon pool. Its Symbol of War adorn (for weapons), that increases view distance, is one of a kind.
Looking at events WRBs, you namely have Ebon Scruug in December that can drop some Presents! for some Luck and Ferocious Cerus in April for his Ferocious Bull's Eye, a weapon adornment with ***4%*** crit rate!

Also, WRBs start to be a decent source of XP. Your XP needs increase much more rapidly than your Orns needs, and WRBs can help you get to T10 quicker, without sacrificing that many Orns.

The best news is that you now also have access to the best source for Summoning Scrolls: Underworld Portals.
In these dungeons, you will encounter all kinds of Balor enemies, including the Balor Gateway that we seek. There's also a T9 version of it, much more tankier (50k HP), that can also drop the scroll. Since the monster pool is much more limited than regular dungeons, the Balor Gateways are much more likely to appear.
These dungeons are also much easier than Chaos Portals. However, keep an eye out for the Berserk Reapers!

As for regular dungeons, we're now looking at T7 or T9 floors.
T9 dungeons have 10 T9 floors.

Overall, for farming Summoning Scrolls (from most efficient to less efficient):
  - Party Underworld Portals
  - Party Chaos Portals
  - Solo Horde Underworld Portals
  - Solo Underworld Portals
  - Solo Horde Chaos Portals
  - Solo Chaos Portals
  - Party regular T9 dungeons
  - Party regular T8 dungeons
  - Party regular T7 dungeons
  - Solo regular T9 dungeons
  - Solo regular T8 dungeons
  - Solo regular T7 dungeons

Tier 10 unleashes the full power of the WRBs! However, you are going to care less and less about the experience here and more about the drops. You may summon the dreadful Arisen Morrigan. Some of her drops are the best in the game, but killing her might prove to be a challenge.
Equipment drops for T10 WRBs are largely discussed throughout the server, so I'm not going to make a rundown here.

T10 portals now have 22 floors instead of 20, for a bit more monsters.
T10 regular dungeons have only 9 T9 floors, making them slightly less efficient than their regular T9 counterparts. However overall, you would probably want the T10 dungeons more for the other rewards it offers (Godforging!). This list focuses exclusively on Summoning Scrolls, so we rank T10 regular dungeons _below_ T9 regular dungeons.

Overall, for farming Summoning Scrolls (from most efficient to less efficient):
  - Party Underworld Portals
  - Party Chaos Portals
  - Solo Horde Underworld Portals
  - Solo Underworld Portals
  - Solo Horde Chaos Portals
  - Solo Chaos Portals
  - Party regular T9 dungeons
  - Party regular T10 dungeons
