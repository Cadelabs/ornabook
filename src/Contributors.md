# Contributors, credits and thanks
This project would not have been complete without the help and support of many people in the community. From those who spent time figuring out the mechanics to those who directly contributed to the writing of this book, it would be impossible to thank everyone individually, so we thank to the community as a whole.

Furthermore, we would like to more specifically address our thanks to the following people who directly contributed to this book:
  - BigYoshi for numerous contributions to the [Glossary](./Glossary.md).
  - jiujitsupatricia for contributing the [Dungeons](./Dungeons.md) page and adding information to the [WRB](./WorldRaidBosses.md) page.
  - Knight411 for sharing his knowledge and his Dungeon Floors per tier chart.
