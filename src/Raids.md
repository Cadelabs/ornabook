<div class="title">Raids</div>

Raids are powerful enemies that can be summoned through special means or very rarely found naturally in the overworld.
There exists 3 main different kinds of raids:
- World Raids, fought on the overworld, summoned by players or naturally spawned
- Kingdom Raids, started by expending Kingdom Orns
- Super Raids, event raids (summoned by players) who are more powerful than other raids

WRBs give high amounts of XP up until T9. The XP requirements at T10 are such that WRBs no longer are the best XP source. The XP/Orn ratio for WRBs is very high! This means that, if you feel you like you need more Orns than XP, WRBs are not the right focus for you now.
With the 3.0 update, WRBs now also drop a decent amount of random materials, including rarer end-game materials (e.g.: Cursed Ortanite), mid-game boss materials (e.g.: Broken Stone) or herbs.
```

# Kinds of Raids
## World Raids
### Spawning
World Raids (called WRB, for "World Raid Boss") are encountered on the overworld.
They scarcely spawn on the overworld and are so rare that their exact spawning mechanics are impossible to research.
They are usually summoned by players through the use of different scrolls, the most common one being the :summoning_scroll: [Summoning Scroll](https://playorna.com/codex/items/summoning-scroll/).

Using a WRB-summoning item will spawn one WRB in the vicinity of the player's location.
Since Wayvessels change a player's location, if the player has travelled through a Wayvessel, the WRB is summoned at the Wayvessel location, rather than the player's GPS location.
A WRB is randomly selected from the "[Raid Pool](#raid-pool)" associated with the item and summoned.
The Raid Pool is different for each summoning item and may vary further depending on active events.
It also changes depending on the player's tier: a player can only summon a WRB of its tier, 1 tier below or 2 tiers below (for that matter, T11 counts as T10, so both T11 and T10 can summon T8, T9 or T10 WRBs).

A WRB can either be "public" or "private".
When publicly summoned, the WRB is visible and can be attacked by any nearby-passing player (or through a Wayvessel).
When privately summoned, the WRB is only visible and can only be attacked by any nearby-passing *party member* of the player who summoned the WRB.
:summoning_scroll: Summoning Scrolls offer the player to choose between the two, while other items will always summon a private WRB.
Once summoned, a WRB stays on the overworld until defeated; they cannot naturally despawn.

### WRB summoning items
- :summoning_scroll: [Summoning Scroll](https://playorna.com/codex/items/summoning-scroll/)
- :monumental_scroll: [Monumental's Summoning Scroll](https://playorna.com/codex/items/monumentals-summoning-scroll/)
- :festive_scroll: [Festive Summoning Scroll](https://playorna.com/codex/items/festive-summoning-scroll/)
- :crimson_scroll: Crimson Summoning Scroll ([Aries](https://playorna.com/codex/items/crimson-summoning-scroll-aries/), [Cerus](https://playorna.com/codex/items/crimson-summoning-scroll-cerus/), [Perseus](https://playorna.com/codex/items/crimson-summoning-scroll-perseus/))
- :moondrop: [Celestial Moondrop](https://playorna.com/codex/items/celestial-moondrop/)

### Raid Pool
#### Summoning Scrolls Raid Pool
The most complex Raid Pool is that of the :summoning_scroll: Summoning Scroll.
It is divided into two parts: permanent raids, available throughout the year, and event raids, available only during the event of said raid.

Permanent raids are:
  - T6: :fey_gazer: [Fey Gazer](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-gazer/)
  - T7: :fey_dragon: [Fey Dragon](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-dragon/), :first_horseman: [First Horseman](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/first-horseman/), :yggdrasil: [Yggdrasil](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/yggdrasil/)
  - T8: :fey_cockatrice: [Fey Cockatrice](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-cockatrice/), :second_horseman: [Second Horseman](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/second-horseman/)
  - T9: :fey_yeti: [Fey Yeti](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-yeti/), :third_horseman: [Third Horseman](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/third-horseman/)
  - T10: :fey_chimera: [Fey Chimera](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-chimera/), :final_horseman: [Final Horseman](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/final-horseman/), :arisen_morrigan: [Arisen Morrigan](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/arisen-morrigan/), :arisen_yggdrasil: [Arisen Yggdrasil](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/arisen-yggdrasil/), :ashen_phoenix: [Ashen Phoenix](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/ashen-phoenix/)

Depending on the event, numerous other raids can be summoned.
The full list of which raids can be summoned is found in [List of Raids](#list-of-raids).
Event raids in the list with a :summoning_scroll: icon can be summoned using Summoning Scrolls **only while their event is active**.
The Summoning Scroll only summons World Raids and cannot summon a Super Raid.

#### Monumental's Summoning Scroll Raid Pool
The :monumental_scroll: Monumental's Summoning Scroll summons raids from the event raids of the :summoning_scroll: Summoning Scroll.
Using it is exactly as using a regular Summoning Scroll but filtering out permanent raids.
It follows that while it summons event raids, it cannot summon raids that a Summoning Scroll cannot summon (Super Raids, raids which have their own summoning item).

#### Festive Summoning Scroll Raid Pool
:festive_scroll: Festive Summoning Scrolls can only be used during the Winter Wild Hunts event.
They only summon event raids from **active** events, but aren't bound to the limitations of the :monumental_scroll: Monumental's Summoning Scroll.
They are able to summon Super Raids as well as Kingdom Raids.
Furthermore, they ignore the _at most 2 tiers below_ restriction of scrolls; they may summon raids more than 2 tiers below your own tier.

They can be crafted during the Winter Wild Hunts event at the Monumental Guild in the Archcrafting section from 6 [Stranger's Gift](https://playorna.com/codex/items/strangers-gift/) and 25 :proof_monument:[Proofs of Monument](https://playorna.com/codex/items/proof-of-monument/).

```admonish todo "ethiraric(2025/04/04)"
Can they spawn raids of a tier higher than you?
```

#### Crimson Summoning Scrolls and Celestial Moondrops
:crimson_scroll: Crimson Summoning Scrolls and :moondrop: Celestial Moondrops are event items which summon from a very limited Raid Pool.
From an implementation point of view, they behave like [Super Raids](#differences-from-wrb).
From a gameplay point of view, they do not _feel_ like Super Raids: they are as strong as regular WRBs and their drops are on-par with other WRBs.
The [List of Raids](#list-of-raids) lists which raids are summoned by these items.

:crimson_scroll: Crimson Summoning Scrolls can be crafted during the Crimson Festival event at the Monumental Guild in the Archcrafting section from 10 Essence ([Aries](https://playorna.com/codex/items/essence-of-aries/), [Cerus](https://playorna.com/codex/items/essence-of-cerus/), [Perseus](https://playorna.com/codex/items/essence-of-perseus/)) and a :summoning_scroll: Summoning Scroll.

:moondrop: Celestial Moondrops are dropped from [Fallen Moonchasers](https://playorna.com/codex/monsters/fallen-moonchaser/) and [Fallen Crescent-Fencers](https://playorna.com/codex/monsters/fallen-crescent-fencer/) during the Of Giants and Titans event.

### Farming Summoning Scrolls
#### Sources
:summoning_scroll: Summoning Scrolls are mostly obtained from defeating :gateway: Balor Gateways (T7 or T9). You can also acquire them:
  - As a drop from the :fey_yeti: [Fey Yeti](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/fey-yeti/) or :the_fool_t9: [The Fool (T9)](https://playorna.com/codex/raids/the-fool-ef1c6cb2/) WRB
  - As a reward for clearing a floor in a Tower of Olympia
  - As a reward for clearing a floor in a Monument
  - As a reward for clearing a dungeon
  - From your Citadel (up to 3 Summoning Scrolls at once)
  - From the Runeshop Daily Gift
  - As a reward in the Archpath
  - From a Guild Shop (except Circle of Anguish)
      - Blade of Finesse: 50 :proof_sparring:[Proofs of Sparring](https://playorna.com/codex/items/proof-of-sparring/)
      - Conqueror: 15 :proof_crownship:[Proofs of Crownship](https://playorna.com/codex/items/proof-of-crownship/)

      - Spelunking: 250 :deepshard:[Refined Deepshards](https://playorna.com/codex/items/deepshard/)
      - Titanfelled: 5000 :tower_shard:[Tower Shards](https://playorna.com/codex/items/tower-shard/)
      - Traveler: 8 :proof_distance:[Proofs of Distance](https://playorna.com/codex/items/proof-of-distance/)

#### Farming
If targetting only :summoning_scroll: Summoning Scrolls, the fastest way would be running :underworld_portal:Underworld Portals or :chaos_portal:Chaos Portals.
Otherwise, running regular dungeons, the preferred tiers are T9, then T10, then T8 and finally T7.

The introduction of guilds has given rise to more ways of farming Summoning Scrolls passively while taking on other activities.
The most notable ones are the Titanfelled and Monumental guilds.
Both these guilds allow for farming their currency to buy Summoning Scrolls while granting a chance at earning them while farming the currency.

Notes:
  - Balor Gateways can very rarely be found on the overworld, but only in Moonlight weather (or by using Chaos Scrolls). We ignored that in this section, as this is by no means a reliable way of farming Summoning Scrolls.
  - Summoning Scrolls are not a _guaranteed_ drop from Balor Gateways, even when reaching the Luck cap.
  - Party Dungeons are preferred to solo dungeons. With a full party of 4, each member can enter the dungeon as a host for the others, meaning a single dungeon location can lead up to 4 runs.

## Kingdom Raids

## Super Raids
Super Raids are stronger World Raids that mean to be a "final boss" for the event.

### Differences from WRB
- Super Raids cannot be summoned by a :summoning_scroll: Summoning Scroll or a :monumental_scroll: Monumental's Summoning Scroll.
- Items dropped from Super Raids do not appear in the Monumental Guild Shop to be rolled expending Proofs of Avarice.

# Sharing raids

## Sanding
Sanding a Raid means hitting it for as little damage as possible with the only goal being to enter the Raid drop pool.
Any player who deals 2 or more damage to a Raid is eligible for Raid rewards.
Since items from raid have a minimum (TBD) chance of dropping, even hitting Arisen Morrigan (34MHP) for 2 damage may reward the player with multiple items.
Sanding effectively increases the overall rewards sent out from a defeated Raid.

```admonish example "Example (math warning)"
Let's *assume* the minimum drop chance for an item is 1%.
The maximum drop chance for a legendary-rarity item is 45%.
Ashen Phoenix has 11,300,000 HP.

In a perfect (and also unreasonable) scenario, 5,650,000 people could hit it for 2 damage.
This means the assumed 1% drop chance for a legendary-rarity item would be rolled 5,650,000 times, yielding an average of 56,500 items to the community (not to individual players).

In a more realistic scenario, let's assume 10 players hit the raid for 1000 damage each and the 11th player finishes the raid (for 11,290,000 damage out of the 11,300,000 HP).
The 10 sanding players each have the assumed 1% drop chance for the legendary-rarity item.
The 11th player would have dealt ~99.91% damage to the raid and would have an ~44.96% chance of receiving the legendary-rarity item.
The 0.04% drop chance the 11th player gave up in letting the 10 players sand offers them an assumed 1% drop chance each.
```

Sanding takes its name from the [Sands of Aaru](https://playorna.com/codex/spells/sands-of-aaru/) spell.
This spell has a high stat multiplier (meaning it can easily pierce the Raid's defences) but a very low damage multiplier (meaning that once defences are pierced, the damage won't be high).
It also has the advantage of working with both Magic and Attack based builds, taking whichever stat is the highest.
It is the recommended spell to use for sanding.

### Various tips for sanding
- Do not bring any pet / summon with a damaging attack move
- Lower-tier classes have less base offensive stats, making them easier to bring low enough to not deal more than 1000 damage
- [Arisen Monster Tomes](https://playorna.com/codex/items/arisen-monster-tome/) (-125) and [Mighty Mimic Heads](https://playorna.com/codex/items/mighty-mimic-head/) (-50) of high quality heavily bring your offensive stats down if needed (attack and magic in equal amounts)
  - Another more expensive option is using Titan augments ([Lungs of Eos](https://playorna.com/codex/items/lungs-of-eos/) (-135), [Legs of Eos](https://playorna.com/codex/items/legs-of-eos/) (-60), [Lungs of Selene](https://playorna.com/codex/items/lungs-of-selene/) (-45)). They will need to be of high quality to negate the celestial weapon's stat.
  - Other adornments of note are [Ashen Pinion](https://playorna.com/codex/items/ashen-pinion/) (-40) and [Stardust](https://playorna.com/codex/items/stardust/) (-30)
- Sands of Aaru never misses, ensuring your damage on turn 1 before you get attacked and making defensive stats meaningless (do still keep enough Mana)
- If your class of choice does not have Mystic Feather or Second Chance, you may often be quickly forced out of a fight, saving you a bit of time if you need to sand a lot of raids
- Sanding not only applies to WRB but also to Kingdom Raids
- Beware of passives whose stat increase may vary
  - Passives such as Power of the Gods (e.g.: [Gaia](https://playorna.com/codex/classes/35/)) which increase stats and are visible in the Status menu
  - Passives such as Iconoclast (e.g.: [Heretic](https://playorna.com/codex/classes/55/)) which increase stats depending on the battle state and are invisible in the Status menu
  - Global passives such as Origin Town which add 10% to your stats (visible in the Status menu)

### Perfect sanding stats
The following table is an attempt to find the perfect offensive stat value for every raid to deal 2 damage using Sands of Aaru.
The damage dealt depends on the defensive stats of the Raid.
Thankfully, their Defence and Resistance stats are equal, so there is no difference in the Attack or Magic needed.
Figuring out the defensive stats of Raids is a work in progress.
Only Raids whose stats are known are listed below.

```admonish note
The offensive stat is the minimum you need to hit for at least 2 damage.
Due to the wide range of Sands of Aaru's damage multiplier, damage can range from 2 to 4.

Offensive stats 1 or 2 points below that indicated may hit for only 1 damage.
Offensive stats 1 or 2 points above that indicated reduces the odds of hitting for 2 damage and may also hit for 5 damage.
Above that, scaling goes according to Sands of Aaru's damage multiplier.

You can expect your damage to be between `2 + stat_above * 0.07` and `4 + stat_above * 0.15`, with `stat_above` the difference between your offensive stat and that listed in the table.
You should not be 2656 stat points above, as this makes it possible to hit for more than 1000 damage.
```

```admonish abstract "Maths"
The above table was generated by reversing the damage formula.
Instead of the damage being a variable, we use the offensive stat.

Where the damage formula is (PvE, using mag as an example):

\\[
    \text{damage} = \lfloor(\text{mag}*\text{stat-multiplier} - \frac{\text{res}}{2}) * \text{damage-multiplier} \rfloor
\\]

We can reorder terms to have:

\\[
    \text{mag} = \lceil (\frac{\text{damage}}{\text{damage-multiplier}} + \frac{\text{res}}{2}) / \text{stat-multiplier} \rceil
\\]

We replace `stat-multiplier` with Sands of Aaru's one (2.5) and `damage-multiplier` with its lowest bound (0.07).
We can also replace `damage` with 2, which is our target damage.
